# projecjtlakitu

latest working Unity project

<br>

WASD / MouseAim / Spacebar / LeftShift / LeftControl <br>
Move / Cam / Jump / Sprint / WalkToggle <br>
extract all and run 'project lakitu' <br>
alt-F4 to quit! menu really needs to be added too <br>
movement values are currently a bit odd (to be fine tuned), but are way more capable of being modified by items/equipment. this guy can jump in the air 11 times <br>
mousewheel to zoom (edit, i just tested on a second machine and the mouse sensitivity was not good, so i need to add a sensitivity setting too) <br>
